## Add sound

--- task ---
Test your project a few times. Do you notice that sometimes the same number is chosen twice (or more) in a row, which makes the sequence harder to memorise?

Can you make a drum sound play each time the character changes costume? How about a different drum sound depending on which colour is chosen? The code you need to do this is __very__ similar to the code to change the character's costume.

You only need to add two blocks: a `play drum for (0.25) beats`{:class="blocksound"} block and a `item (last) of sequence`{:class="blockdata"} block.

Here are the blocks you need:

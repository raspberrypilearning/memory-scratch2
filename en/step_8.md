## What next?

Try out the next project, [Dodgeball](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dodgeball), where you will make a game in which you have to avoid balls while moving from platform to platform.

Or if you want to try another music-themed Scatch project, you can try the [Binary hero](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/binary-hero) project.
